			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this videography website is to showcase a videographer's talent and artistry. As a budding videographer I aim to help couples envision how the client can capture their special day.
				The site will serve as a portfolio to highlight the client's work, build credibility, and attract potential clients by sharing their unique storytelling style. </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The audience for this site is couples looking for a videographer to capture their wedding day. It will largely be people local to the client's area but could expand to 
				a larger geographical area as they gain experience. Weddings for people in all walks and stages of life should be drawn to see how a wedding video can help enhance their big day. 
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>Javascript will be used to create an inquires form that users can use to reach an and book the videographer. 
				I will aslo use an object to pull the information for each of the different packages. If I have the time 
				I will also create a interactive booking calendar to show when the client is available.
